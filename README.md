 🛍️ E-Commerce Store (Frontend Only)

A modern and beautifully designed E-commerce storefront built using {HTML, CSS, and JavaScript}.  
The project focuses on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly shopping experience that works across all screen sizes 📱💻.

This is a {frontend-only} project (no backend), created some time ago as part of my journey in web development.  
It showcases my ability to design attractive layouts, responsive components, and smooth user interactions.
